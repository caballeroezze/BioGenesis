# Data Analytics Project M4: COVID-19 Impact and Vaccination in Latin America

## üìã Project Summary
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 and vaccination trends in six Latin American countries: **Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru**. The analysis was conducted for the pharmaceutical company **BIOGENESYS** to identify optimal locations for expanding pharmaceutical laboratories and vaccination centers.

### Objectives
1. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, and healthcare infrastructure.
2. Identify trends and correlations through visualizations and statistical techniques.
3. Optimize decision-making for the expansion of laboratories in regions requiring improved access to vaccines and healthcare services.

  - Analyzing trends in COVID-19 cases, fatalities, and vaccination progress.
  - Identifying demographic and infrastructural disparities.

### 2. **Dashboard (Power BI)**
- Interactive dashboard summarizing key findings:
  - Temporal trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
  - Vaccination progress by country.
  - Population distribution by age groups.
  - Healthcare infrastructure and socioeconomic indicators.
  - Comparison of vaccine effectiveness in reducing cases.

### 3. **Final Report (Word Document)**

## üìä Key Insights
### 1. COVID-19 Case Trends
- **Brazil and Mexico** reported the highest numbers of cases and mortality rates.
- Temporal analysis revealed infection waves between **mid-2021 and early 2022**.

### 2. Vaccination Impact
- **Chile and Argentina** excelled in vaccination campaigns, achieving a more effective reduction in new cases.
- Countries with lower vaccination rates experienced prolonged infection waves.

### 3. Healthcare Infrastructure
- Disparities in healthcare resource availability:
  - **Chile**: Highest density of doctors and nurses per 1,000 inhabitants.
  - **Peru and Colombia**: Limited access to healthcare, representing strategic opportunities for BIOGENESYS.

### 4. Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors
- Densely populated urban areas (e.g., Brazil, Mexico) faced greater challenges.
- Countries with higher comorbidity rates (e.g., diabetes, smoking) showed higher mortality rates.

## üöÄ Recommendations
1. **Expand Healthcare Infrastructure**: Prioritize regions with limited access to healthcare services (e.g., rural areas in Peru and Colombia).
2. **Strengthen Vaccination Campaigns**: Improve logistics and distribution in countries like Mexico and Brazil.
3. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Collaborate with governments to enhance medical accessibility.
4. **Future Preparedness**: Invest in data-driven strategies to plan pandemic responses.
